                        I know we haven't been together long Mya but I cannot describe how much you've already helped me<br /> become a better person and help me realize that love is worth pursuing.
                        I can't even come up with words to describe <br />how much I appreciate and love you for everything that you have done for me up to this point. Whether it be helping push me through<br /> whatever bs
                        my computer science homework is, helping push me to care about my health, playing dumb funny video games with me, hell even meeting my<br /> family and making it fun. I can't wait to see what the
                        future has for us. You said it best to me one night that fate is real and I believe<br /> that we were meant to meet and have what we have! Thank you for taking this journey with me. I love you so much &lt;3!
